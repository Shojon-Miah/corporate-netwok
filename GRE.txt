What OSI layer is GRE?
GRE is defined by RFC 2784 and as a tunneling protocol, 
carries OSI layer 3 protocols in the network. GRE creates 
a private point-to-point connection, just like that of a virtual private network.

What is the benefit of GRE tunnel?
The advantage of GRE over other tunneling protocols is that 
it can encapsulate broadcast, multicast traffic (multicast streaming 
or routing protocols) or other non-IP protocols. GRE packets can be 
protected by using Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) ensuring confidentiality 
and integrity of the tunneled traffic.
